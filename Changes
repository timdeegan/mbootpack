Version 0.5a (January 2007)
---------------------------

Fixed a type-size error that made 64-bit builds choke on the ELF program
headers.


Version 0.4a (April 2005)
-------------------------

Added this change log. 

Added check to catch kernels loading at very high addresses.

Tidied makefile dependency generation so 'make clean' doesn't rebuild 
the setup sectors.


Version 0.3a (March 2005)
-------------------------

Added checks to detect and warn if the input files are compressed.

Changed kernel loader to ignore zero-length sections in ELF kernel phdrs
(GNU GRUB has one).


Version 0.2a (March 2005)
-------------------------

Changed the location of the MBI and associated data from just after the 
kernel to just below the 640k memory hole, because Xen assumes they will be 
below 1MB and might overwrite them otherwise.

Added support for providing the command-line at boot time, and for 
splitting the boot command-line between the kernel and the first module.

Removed pack-as-multiboot option, which was really a debugging feature.


Version 0.1a (November 2004)
----------------------------

Initial alpha release
