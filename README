mbootpack
---------

This is a utility to take a multiboot kernel and modules and repackage
them in a form that a standard linux bootloader will be able to load them.
It statically allocates memory addresses based on a 'standard' PC memory 
layout, and then saves the image of the loaded system, along with an 
almost-standard linux bzImage header which takes care of the start-of-day 
requirements of a multiboot kernel (setting up 32-bit protected mode, etc.)

Example invocation, to package a xen VMM and xenlinux guest and initrd:

   mbootpack -o bzImage -m ./xenlinux -m ./initrd.img ./xen-image

You can now boot the 'bzImage' file using your favourite linux bootloader.

The kernel command line will be provided at boot time by the bootloader
(you can specify a kernel command-line using the '-c' flag, but it will
be overridden at boot time unledd the bootloder provides an entirely
empty command line).  If you wan to override the command line for the
first module (i.e. domain 0 kernel in Xen) at boot time, append ' -- '
and the module commadn line to the bootloader command line, e.g.:

  boot: bzImage com1=9600,8n1 console=com1 dom0_mem=49152 -- root=/dev/sda3 ro console=ttyS0,9600n8 

Everything before the '--' is passed to the kernel (xen) as its command
line; everything after is passed to the first module (xenlinux).

This is ALPHA code: there are execution paths which have *not* been
tested, though it works for loading the Xen hypervisor using GrUB, LILO
or SYSLINUX.  Bug reports and patches are very welcome.

Possible features for future versions (all look possible, if there's any 
demand for them):

    - support for kernels that load below 1MB
    - zImage-style compressed images
    - support for the MULTIBOOT_VIDEO_MODE bit
    - proper support for passing E820h memory-maps from bzImage
