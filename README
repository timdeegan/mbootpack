mbootpack
---------

This is a utility to take a multiboot kernel and modules and repackage
them in a form that a standard linux bootloader will be able to load them.
It statically allocates memory addresses based on a 'standard' PC memory 
layout, and then saves the image of the loaded system, along with an 
almost-standard linux bzImage header which takes care of the start-of-day 
requirements of a multiboot kernel (setting up 32-bit protected mode, etc.)

Example invocation, to package a xen VMM and xenolinux guest:

   mbootpack -c "com1=9600,8n1 console=com1,tty dom0_mem=65536 noht"  \
             -m "./xenolinux console=ttyS0,9600n8 root=/dev/sda3 ro"  \
             -o bzImage ./xen-image

You can now boot the 'bzImage' file using your favourite linux bootloader.

With the '-M' flag, it produces a multiboot image instead of a bzImage.
Thsi is mostly for testing, but might be useful if you have a multiboot
loader that can't load multiple modules.

This is ALPHA code: there are execution paths which nhave *not* been tested, 
though it works for loading the Xen hypervisor.  Bug reports and patches
are very welcome, though I can't promise to be able to fix any problems.

Possible features for future versions (all look possible, if there's any 
demand for them):

    - support for kernels that load below 1MB
    - zImage-style compressed images
    - support for the MULTIBOOT_VIDEO_MODE bit
    - proper support for passing E820h memory-maps from bzImage
    - allow the command-line to be specified at boot time
